Task 01

Generate simple text using a pre-trained GPT model.

Task Details: Use a pre-trained GPT model to generate
coherent and contextually relevant text.

Resource: OpenAI GPT-2 Documentation


Task 02

Create a basic image with style transfer using a
pre-trained model.

Task Details: Apply style transfer to create an image
by combining content and style from different
sources.

Resource: Fast Style Transfer


Task 03

Develop a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
to generate synthetic images.

Task Details: Build and train a GAN to create new,
synthetic images based on input data.

Resource: GANs in PyTorch


Task 04

Implement a text-to-image generation model
using Stable Diffusion or DALL-E.

Task Details: Create images from textual
descriptions using models like Stable Diffusion or
DALL-E.

Resource: Stable Diffusion Documentation


Task 05

Fine-tune a large language model for domain-
specific text generation or translation tasks.

Task Details: Customize a large language model to
generate text or perform translations tailored to a
specific domain.

Resource: Hugging Face Transformers
